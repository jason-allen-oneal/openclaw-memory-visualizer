# openclaw-memory-visualizer

A high-performance graph visualizer for OpenClaw memory structures.

## Features

- **Interactive Topology**: Visualize the connections between your files, concepts, and events.
- **Direct Live-Edit**: Edit backing markdown files directly from the graph side-panel.
- **Node Management**: Secure deletion protocol with automated backups.
- **Semantic Discovery**: Visualizes relationships based on wikilinks, tags, and text similarity.

## Ecosystem

This tool is designed to work seamlessly with the [openclaw-memopt](https://github.com/jason-allen-oneal/openclaw-memopt) protocol. By following the `memopt` conventions (wikilinks, hashtags, and semantic headers), your memory graph will be automatically structured into a high-signal knowledge map.
